## ⚠️ Missing Features (Based on Requirements)

### Core Requirements
- ❌ **REST API Endpoints**: Project uses Supabase client instead of traditional REST API endpoints (/api/employees)
- ❌ **SQLite Database**: Uses PostgreSQL (Supabase) instead of SQLite (PostgreSQL is more robust for production)

### Bonus Features
- ❌ **Search/Filter Bar**: No search functionality to find employees by name, department, or position
- ❌ **Enhanced Form Validation**: Basic validation exists, but could be improved with:
  - Email format validation with visual feedback
  - Phone number format validation
  - Salary range validation
  - Real-time validation feedback
- ❌ **Test Cases**: No automated tests for:
  - Backend CRUD operations
  - Frontend components
  - Business logic
  - Integration tests

### Additional Enhancements Not in Requirements
- ✅ Visual analytics dashboard (Extra feature)
- ✅ Multiple employee fields beyond basic requirements
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Animated UI elements
